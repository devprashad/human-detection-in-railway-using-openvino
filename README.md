## Intel oneAPI AI Toolkit with OpenVINO
![openvino-architecture-intel](https://github.com/devprashad/human-detection-in-railway-using-openvino/assets/110773439/bdc56590-3e19-45b8-bbcc-46d681a07b12)

Intel® oneAPI AI Toolkit, featuring OpenVINO, is a comprehensive toolkit designed to optimize and deploy deep learning models across various Intel hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, VPUs (Video Processing Units), and FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays). It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to:

### Key Features 

1. **Model Conversion**: Convert pre-trained models from popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ONNX into a format optimized for Intel hardware. This conversion process ensures efficient execution and leverages hardware capabilities for faster inference.

2. **Deep Learning Inference**: Execute the optimized models on various Intel hardware platforms for real-time or near-real-time applications. OpenVINO provides APIs for integrating the models into different programming languages like C++, Python, and Java.

3. **Performance Optimization**: OpenVINO offers various techniques to fine-tune models for specific hardware targets. This can involve techniques like quantization (reducing the number of bits used to represent weights), pruning (removing redundant connections), and kernel fusion (combining multiple operations into a single one).


### How to Get Started:
To get started with Intel oneAPI AI Toolkit, visit the [official documentation](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit.html) and follow the installation instructions. You can also explore tutorials and examples to learn more about the toolkit's capabilities and how to use it in your projects.


### Image Acquisition

A camera or video source captures real-time video footage of the railway tracks.

### Preprocessing

The captured frames undergo preprocessing to ensure consistency and optimal performance for the inference model. This may involve resizing, normalization, or color space conversion.

### Anomaly Detection Model

A pre-trained deep learning model, potentially fine-tuned on a railway image dataset, is utilized to identify anomalies in the video frames.

### OpenVINO Inference Engine

The trained model is optimized and deployed using OpenVINO for efficient inference on hardware accelerators like CPUs or VPUs.

### Alert Generation

When the model detects an anomaly, an alert is triggered, notifying the railway authorities for further investigation.

## Future Scope

As we look ahead, there are several exciting avenues for further development and enhancement of our railway safety alert system. Here are some key areas we plan to explore:

- **Integration with existing railway infrastructure:** We aim to seamlessly integrate our alert system with existing railway infrastructure to enable efficient and automated alert notification mechanisms. This integration will involve collaboration with railway authorities and the implementation of standardized communication protocols.

- **Exploration of more advanced anomaly detection models:** While our current system achieves commendable accuracy in detecting anomalies on railway tracks, there is always room for improvement. We plan to explore and evaluate more advanced anomaly detection models, including state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and techniques. By leveraging cutting-edge research in this field, we aim to further enhance the accuracy and reliability of our system.

- **Implementation of edge computing:** To enable on-device anomaly detection on trains, we plan to explore the implementation of edge computing techniques. By deploying lightweight inference models directly on-board trains, we can minimize reliance on external infrastructure and ensure real-time anomaly detection even in remote or disconnected environments. This approach will also reduce latency and enhance the responsiveness of our alert system.

```
3. **Run the application:** Instruct users on how to execute the script to launch the alert system.
In order to view the YOLO v8 Model which is trained:
```
python3 trainmodel.py
````
In order to view the Open-vino model:
```
python3 openvino.py
```
This will enable the rendering of the view which is sources from the camera, in order to change the video, the source should be changed, which is fed in the model, instead of 0 which directs the source to camera, change it to path of the video.


Before 
```
result=ov_model(source=0,stream=True)
```
After 
```
result=ov_model(source='c\desktop\file1\file2',stream=True)
```
